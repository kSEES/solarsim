        <h2>Mercury</h2>
        <p>
          Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system, only being 1,516
          mi in radius. This planet is not appropriate for organsims to live on
          due to its high temperatures and solar radiation. Temperatures can
          reach up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The surface of Mercury resembles
          Earth's Moon due to the craters and asteroids. It spins slowly on its
          axis.

          Earth is the fifth largest planet in our solar system. This is the
          most hosipitable planet due to its temperature and chemicals. It
          completes one rotation every 24 hours and 365 days to complete a
          single trip. Earth has a single moon which helps keep the climate
          consistent. There are four layers that compose the Earth, those being
          the inner core, outer core, mantle, and crust.

        <h2>Mars</h2>
        <p>
          Mars is the only planet that has had rover to roam around its
          landscape. These rovers are used to search for signs of life that may
          have existed previously. One rotation is completed 24.6 hours which is
          similar to Earth's rotation. Mars has two moons, Deimos and Phobos.
          They are shaped weirdly due to their lack of mass to make them into a
          spherical shape. The surface of Mars contains various colors such as
          brown, gold, and tan.

        <p>
          Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system. The temperatures of
          the planet are too extreme for organisms to adapt to. FIt is 11 times
          wider than Earth. One day on Jupiter is around 10 hours and one orbit
          around the sun is around 12 Earth years. Jupiter has four large moons
          and many smaller moons. In a way, Jupiter has its own mini solar
          system.

        <h2>Saturn</h2>
        <p>
          Saturn is the second-largest planet in our solar system. It is made of
          helium and hydrogen. Similar to other planets, Saturns environment is
          not suitable for organisms to adapt to. One day on Saturn is around 11
          hours and a complete orbit is around 29 Earth years. As of 2023,
          Saturn has 146 moons that are in orbit. Its rings are composed of
          small chunks of ice and rock that are coated with dust.

          Uranus has the third largest diameter of our solar system. One day on
          Uranus is around 17 hours and one complete orbit around the sun takes
          around 84 Earth years. Uranus contains 28 known moons. It's also four
          times wider than Earth. The environment is also not appropriate for
          life.

        <p>
          Neptune is 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth. Neptune is also the
          only planet that cannot be viewed from the naked eye. One day on
          Neptune is around 16 hours and a complete orbit takes around 165 Earth
          years. There are 16 known moons that Neptune has. Neptune also
          contains five main rings and four ring arcs. Its atmosphere is
          composed of mostly hydrogen and helium.
