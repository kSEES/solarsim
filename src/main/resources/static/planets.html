    <h1>Planets of Our Solar System</h1>
    <p>
        On this page, you can view up to date information about all the planets of our solar system. Just hover over the
        planet to see the information.
    </p>

    <h2>Mercury</h2>
    <p>
        Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. This planet is not appropriate for organsims to live on.
        Temperatures can reach up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The surface of Mercury resembles Earth's Moon due to the
        craters and asteroids. It spins slowly on its axis.
    </p>

    <h2>Venus</h2>
    <p>
        Mercury is the second planet from the Sun and also spins slowly on its axis. Its size is similar to Earth's and
        its thick atmosphere makes it the hottest planet in our solar system. The surface temperature of Venus ranges
        from 86 to 158 degrees Fahrenheit. One day on Venus is equivalent to 243 Earth days. Venus and Mercury do not
        have moons.
    </p>

    <h2>Earth</h2>
    <p>
        Earth is the fifth largest planet in our solar system. This is the most hosipitable planet due to its temperature
        and chemicals. It completes one rotation every 24 hours and 365 days to complete a single trip. Earth has a
        single moon which helps keep the climate consistent. There are four layers that compose the Earth, those being
        the inner core, outer core, mantle, and crust.
    </p>

    <h2>Mars</h2>
    <p>
        Mars is the only planet that has had rover to roam around its landscape. These rovers are used to search for
        signs of life that may have existed previously. One rotation is completed 24.6 hours which is similar to Earth's
        rotation. Mars has two moons, Deimos and Phobos. They are shaped weirdly due to their lack of mass to make them
        into a spherical shape. The surface of Mars contains various colors such as brown, gold, and tan.
    </p>

    <h2>Jupiter</h2>
    <p>
        Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system. The temperatures of the planet are too extreme for organisms
        to adapt to. FIt is 11 times wider than Earth. One day on Jupiter is around
        10 hours and one orbit around the sun is around 12 Earth years. Jupiter has four large moons and many smaller
        moons. In a way, Jupiter has its own mini solar system.
    </p>

    <h2>Saturn</h2>
    <p>
        Saturn is the second-largest planet in our solar system. It is made of helium and hydrogen. Similar to other
        planets, Saturns environment is not suitable for organisms to adapt to. One day on Saturn is around 11 hours and
        a complete orbit is around 29 Earth years. As of 2023, Saturn has 146 moons that are in orbit. Its rings are
        composed of small chunks of ice and rock that are coated with dust.
    </p>

    <h2>Uranus</h2>
    <p>
        Uranus has the third largest diameter of our solar system. One day on Uranus is around 17 hours and one complete
        orbit around the sun takes around 84 Earth years. Uranus contains 28 known moons. It's also four times wider
        than Earth. The environment is also not appropriate for life.
    </p>

    <h2>Neptune</h2>
    <p>
        Neptune is 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth. Neptune is also the only planet that cannot be viewed from the
        naked eye. One day on Neptune is around 16 hours and a complete orbit takes around 165 Earth years. There are 16
        known moons that Neptune has. Neptune also contains five main rings and four ring arcs. Its atmosphere is
        composed of mostly hydrogen and helium.
